Here I Mentioned the Steps which I performed for this LAB


Task 1: Create an S3 Bucket and Upload Files
1.	Create an S3 Bucket:
o	Go to the AWS S3 Console.
o	Click Create bucket and provide a unique bucket name (e.g., my-file-storage-bucket).
o	Select a region and adjust settings if required. Leave "Block all public access" enabled for now.
o	Click Create bucket.
2.	Upload 5 Files:
o	Open the newly created bucket.
o	Click Upload and add 5 files with different extensions (e.g., .txt, .jpg, .pdf, .csv, .mp4).
o	Click Upload to complete the process.

Task 2: Enable Versioning and Verify
1.	Enable Versioning:
o	Go to the bucket’s Properties tab.
o	Under Bucket Versioning, click Edit, enable versioning, and save changes.
2.	Re-upload 2 Files:
o	Go to the bucket’s Objects tab.
o	Select and re-upload any 2 of the files you uploaded earlier.
o	After re-uploading, go to the Versions tab for the bucket and confirm that multiple versions of the files are displayed.

Task 3: Host a Static Website and Add Lifecycle Rules
1.	Host a Static Website:
o	Use the bucket created in Task 1.
o	Go to the Properties tab and enable Static Website Hosting.
o	Set:
	Index document: index.html
	Error document: error.html
o	Upload index.html and error.html to the bucket. Ensure both are publicly accessible by updating bucket permissions or attaching a public-read bucket policy.
2.	Add Lifecycle Rules:
o	Go to the bucket’s Management tab.
o	Under Lifecycle Rules, click Create lifecycle rule.
o	Name the rule (e.g., TransitionAndExpire).
o	Set the scope to apply to all objects.
o	Add two actions:
	Transition: Move objects to Standard-IA after 60 days.
	Expiration: Permanently delete objects after 200 days.
o	Save the rule.
